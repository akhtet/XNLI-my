305
um no i live off campus
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

306
yeah it's ours up here we have our rural connections are real bad
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

307
men um free of the charge one guy went in stabbed his ex-wife to death because she was sleeping with another guy i mean ex-wife you know we're talking and
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

308
and uh i kind of kind of like the black eyed pea but i don't think it's a chain
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

309
is that like match savings
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

310
it was um from uh um Wills Point i don't know if you're familiar with
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

311
but on the other hand we've eaten a lot of raccoon and possum and turtle all kinds of
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

312
i mean there was  had the i had my watch and it was all over my shoes and uh the shrubs all turned white down there
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

313
one of the benefits we get of course is travel
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

314
they do it as a labor of love so the officer idea is a good idea
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

315
so it it looked pretty sharp
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

316
and we keep our cans in one thing and glass in another and paper in another it once it gets full getting it loaded into the car and taking it is a pain
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

317
Locust Hill uh-huh right oh great
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

318
i have a tiff Bermuda lawn here and uh it requires a lot of water and you have to keep it cut very short if you want it to look like a golf course green
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

319
the the extra nickel or what is it extra thirty cents for a for a for six bottles everybody everybody comes across the border  to buy the cheaper the the cheaper drinks
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

320
it's it's really bad it uh i
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

321
yeah i can hear him
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

322
yeah it was pretty reasonable
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

323
so um  we usually meet like at my uncle's cottage in the um at the lake and uh make a couple days of it
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

324
uh whenever you buy an item especially a large purchase item it it's it's something in which you're you're paying and you've always got to add in that about ten percent tax
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

325
exactly and i was very flattered until she told me she the company she was with
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

326
have you read The Firm
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

327
yeah and we just kind of we kept uh kind of uh it was a surprise birthday party for her was what it was
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

328
which is a little unusual but its done through the auspices
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

329
that's what she plans to do so i hope so
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

330
i don't know coming from Texas you're probably i don't know i i shouldn't make stereo types but gun control is probably frowned on quite a bit down there i would think
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

331
uh-huh oh she's great she's you know she's a character she'll sit with anybody she'll play with anybody
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

332
exactly but i mean with the new laws it's really it's tough now
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

333
course that might up crime you know and uh people go in and steal your television and steal and sell it just because they can't they can't work anymore you know
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

334
golly you know he didn't even follow any of the rules and i and didn't even seem to bother of course they kicked him right out
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

335
yeah it just doesn't seem possible does it
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

336
it's pretty much going between Washington they're undefeated and uh Buffalo New Orleans and Chicago because Chicago's only lost twice and one of those was to Buffalo
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

337
uh-huh um yes we do have tax on clothes
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

338
oh i see well i like the atmosphere myself
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

339
yeah they had a whole bunch of things that that sort of broke at the same time
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

340
um i have one child a little girl who's eighteen months old
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

341
the the second one that she has was one of the puppies from the litter and uh the one male that she used had a tooth problem
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

342
but uh so you like different foods huh
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

343
oh is that where you're talking from
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

344
uh-huh how do you feel the newspapers there in Colorado Springs treats local interest news
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

345
i honestly i don't know because i haven't had to wear that many dress clothes yet to be honest you know
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

346
you know one other benefit that that just occurred to me i didn't take it as much advantage of it at least not yet in  sometimes big companies will pay for like education
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

347
well why don't you start because you've had more time to think about it if you don't mind
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

348
um-hum do you find that you're uh  uh disappointed or pleased with uh uh the performance of like network coverage of news
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

349
did you go to museums in Europe
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

350
there you go well does you husband uh what does he think of your uh T-shirt and and
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

351
yeah i don't yeah well what get's me you know this thing it went down to defeat last December by how many votes by just a few hundred votes
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

352
oh um no but they do have hay horse races  at the Oaklawn tracks
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

353
but i know that in some i know in a lot of rural areas they're not that good
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

354
um not even cast aluminum they were just pressed aluminum
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

355
right they will go through the slot
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

356
is it twenty percent interest
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

357
and it still scared me
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

358
now that's one of the best deterrents for a robber is a noisy neighbor even if the neighbor's got a noisy dog that's a deterrent because they know that that dog's going to bark
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

359
uh-huh it's funny and um i i guess i just like funny shows mostly
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

360
and then the second thing i'd probably look at is uh what they can afford
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

361
well i don't remember it seemed like it did but it might not i guess i guess
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

362
with your TV set and you feel that a fitting punishment for television theft is death
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

363
the beach was beautiful and and that was really uh a nice place to go so that's  that's probably one of my most favorite places to go how about you
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

364
throw a Coke ad in there
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

365
i don't know  okay well it was good talking to you and have a good evening
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

366
okay well so let me make sure so so you think that uh maybe a five day waiting period for handguns or that stuff would be legitimate
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

367
yeah when i had a Cocker Spaniel it it was an outdoor dog and uh i think i liked that better uh-huh
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

368
well supposedly in seven days they're going they're going to look through y our background and make sure you are not an ex-con or don't have
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

369
you know i would rather much rather get on a plane and get there and then enjoy myself
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

370
a few months ago that they had six member juries i thought that they you know it was always twelve twelve men tried and true so to speak
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

371
came back from uh uh Grand Rapids where we saw one of our sons graduate
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

372
all the uh credit union CEOs and people like that so she was really into the keeping up on what's going on with the credit unions
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

373
i know everybody's i mean everybody's always busy and worried and so many problems people don't just sit down and you know just talk and know everything's going to be okay
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

374
do you do you wilderness camp
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

375
it's only getting worse exponentially it seems um
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

376
Brian in Plano Texas how are you doing today
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

377
so it um-hum well it doesn't bring anything but chaos
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

378
yeah that's what i i just did today i got uh Darkman have you seen that uh i haven't i'll guess i'll watch it tonight
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

379
oh goodness well i was an English major so i like to read period
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

380
and uh gosh sticks in my mind he paid eighteen hundred dollars for a parrot and that was just mind boggling
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

381
and i really hate to lose them but um that's one of the hazards i guess of uh having a a yard because i
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

382
tag them or anything you you do it all yourself they tell you what to do but you do it all yourself
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

383
and you're the minority and you're stuck with it but uh
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

384
it's probably more because i just enjoy the coverage than it is because i don't have time to read the paper you know
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

385
not just lawyers but police officers and judges and the whole legal profession in general
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

386
themselves and i like some of their songs but as as i agree as a general rule i i wouldn't choose rap either
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

387
satisfaction from what things i've heard
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

388
you know it's easy to say well we'll build a concrete hole and and nothing'll happen and then they'll say well the only way to test that is over a long period of time so
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

389
no not necessarily um it can be in house people who help you handle X amount of dollars
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

390
and uh that was twenty five hundred people when i joined and uh
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

391
uh yeah and i was gonna say uh I'll Fly Away which uh i think it was supposed to uh catch some of the same viewers as uh
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

392
yeah but i don't think we're gonna to do it because it's uh you can't get local stations and that's the news that we're mostly interested in
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

393
and uh he snapped he snapped out of it he uh he was probably uh say ninety five percent himself
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

394
so that's that is a problem what kind of criteria do you look for when you are shopping around
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

395
been nice talking to you
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

396
i'm afraid that um i think his name was Anderson was the the gentleman who ran for uh on an independent ticket against Reagan and
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

397
oh i see oh the state doesn't require it well that's kind of that's rather that's rather unusual isn't it
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

398
yeah i think there's so much more economicable too just like with gas and everything i mean i can go forever on a tank of gas
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

399
a few years ago i was a student there and spent um a semester studying abroad in London
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

400
but they did something a little different with them
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>
